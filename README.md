## General info
The application consists of a web and a mobile hybrid application (Android / IOS). NGOs use the web application to register and expose their cases, that is, a description for each exposed case as well as the amount needed to resolve it. People willing to help make use of the mobile application to view the cases and contact the NGOs to make donations.
